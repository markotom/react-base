# Reakt Base

Another simple base to create web applications using Koa and React (with `create-react-app`). But, looking for a better way to quickly start a project, trying to follow these principles:

* Simple is better than complex.
* Cheap is better than expensive.
* Explicit is better than opaque.
* Purpose is more important than process.
* Insight is more important than precision.
* Understanding is more important than technique.
* Think more, work less

Yesterday I had an epiphany! I never had my own beginning.
